    The input is a string of actions, composed of 0s, 1s or -1s. The actions give
    directions to take on a finite length circle (0 is for stay, 1 is for right,
    -1 is for left). The goal is to give the final position on the circle after
    all the actions have been taken. The agent starts at position 0.

    By default, the length the circle is 5.

    Examples:
      1 -1 0 -1 -1 -> -2 = class 3
      1 1 1 -1 -> 2 = class 2

    Note that the sampling is jittable so it is fast.
